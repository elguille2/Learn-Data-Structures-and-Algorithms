## Introduction

### Whats is a Data Structure?

Data structure:. a named location that can be used to store and organize data.

Example:
+ array:  a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
  ```java
  char[] array = new char[10];
  ```
### What is an Algorithm?

Algorithm: a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

Example: Baking a pizza.
1. Heat the oven to 210Â°C.
2. Place the pizza in the oven.
3. Bake for 15 minutes.

Example: Linear Search Algorithm.
+ One by one, examine the elements of an array to find a value.
  ```java
  int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  int value = 3;
  for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      if (array[i] == value) {
          return i;
      }
  }
  return -1;
  ```
  
### Why learn Data Structures and Algorithms?
1. You will write code that is both time and memory efficient.
2. Commonly asked in technical interviews.

## Basic Data Structures

### Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed.

Methods:
1. push(): adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. pop(): removes the top element from the stack.
3. peek(): returns the top element of the stack.
4. isEmpty(): returns true if the stack is empty.
5. search(): returns the position of an element in the stack.

Uses of stacks?
1. Undo/redo features in text editors.
2. Moving back and forward in a browser.
3. Backtracking algorithms (maze, file directories).
4. Calling functions in programming languages.

### Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added to the queue is the first element to be removed.

In Java, the Queue interface is implemented by the LinkedList class.

```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
```

Methods:
1. Insert:
   2. enqueue(): adds an element to the rear of the queue.
   3. add(): adds an element to the rear of the queue.
   4. offer(): adds an element to the rear of the queue.
2. Remove:
   3. dequeue(): removes the front element from the queue.
   4. remove(): removes the front element from the queue.
   5. poll(): removes the front element from the queue.

Where are queues used?
1. Keyboard buffers (letters should appear in the order they are typed).
2. Printer queues (documents should be printed in the order they are sent).
3. Used in LinkedLists, Priority Queues, Breadth First Search.

### Priority Queues

A priority queue is a data structure that stores elements based on their priority. The element with the highest priority is removed first.

In Java, the PriorityQueue class is used to implement a priority queue.

```java
PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
```
